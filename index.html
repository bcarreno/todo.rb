<h1><a href="https://github.com/danchoi/todo.rb">todo.rb</a>



<h2>Intro</h2>

<p> todo.rb is a command-line todo list manager.  It stores data as simple
lists in flat text files and is highly interoperable with other Unix-style
tools.  </p>

<p>
todo.rb  is inspired by <a
href="http://ginatrapani.github.com/todo.txt-cli/">todo.sh</a> by Gina
Trapani, and takes it further in the direction of the 
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch01s06.html">Unix philosophy</a>.
</p>



<p>

Like <a href="http://wiki.43folders.com/index.php/ToDo.txt">Merlin Mann</a>, I
keep todo lists in plain text files and used Vim to review and edit them.  
But Vim, like every popular text editor, presents a <a
href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RaPwX0sScf4C&lpg=PA93&ots=SNzsy-p8h6&dq=tenet%208%20avoid%20captive&pg=PA93#v=onepage&q&f=false">captive
user interface</a> which removes you from the command line and the immediate
context of whatever you were doing there.  Vim is also  more difficult to
script than a standard, noninteractive Unix tool.

</p>

<p> todo.rb is a todo list tool with an unobtrusive, noncaptive, Unix-style
interface.  It leverages Unix filters to let you view your tasks by
context or project. It uses <strong>ed</strong> under the hood to let you
perform a wide range of edits on your todo.txt without leaving the command line.
</p>

<h2>Requires</h2>
<p>Ruby 1.9</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<pre>$ gem install todo.rb</pre>

<h2>Basics</h2>

<p>
The full command name is todo.rb, but you'll probably want to
alias it to something shorter. Put something like this in your
~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc: 
</p>

<pre>alias t=todo.rb</pre>

<p>
This is a detailed guide to the program. You can type this to get help from the command line:
</p>

<pre>
t -h
</pre>

<p>todo.rb operates in the current working directory. It looks for a todo.txt
and done.txt file, and creates them if they don't already exist.
</p>

<pre>
$ t
Missing a todo.txt file. Creating.
Missing a done.txt file. Creating.
</pre>

<p>
You can start adding tasks like this. 
</p>

<pre>
$ t @harvardsq buy some assam from tealuxe
0a1
> @harvardsq buy some assam from tealuxe
</pre>

<p>
@harvardsq is a <strong>context tag</strong> for your task. A context tag usually indicates a
location, but it can also represent an activity, like @email. The two lines you
see after the command prompt is a diff showing the change you just made.
</p>

<p>
To see the tasks we have accumulated so far, just press t.
</p>

<pre>
$ t
     1  <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
</pre>

<p>
If you look in the file todo.txt, you'll see that all todo.rb is doing besides
printing the file is adding line numbers and coloring the context tags.
</p>

<p>
There is another type of tag you can use when you add tasks: a <strong>project tag</strong>. 
It looks like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ t +opensource release todo.rb
1a2
> +opensource release todo.rb
</pre>

<p>
A project tag need not represent an actual project. It can stand for a topic, a
feature, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
When you print the task list, you'll see that project tags and context tags are
colored differently.  
You can also have more than one tag per task, and you can mix project and context tags.
</p>

<pre>
$ t
     1	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
     2	<span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
</pre>

<p>
Let's add one more task to the @harvardsq context.
</p>

<pre>
$ t @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks
2a3
> @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks

$ t
     1	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
     2	<span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
     3	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

<p>
So when you type <code>t [tag] [task]</code> a new task will be created and tagged.
If you don't want to provide a tag, or if you want to put the tag after the first word
in your task, or if you want to insert a task somewhere other than at the bottom of your todo list,
you need to use another syntax to create a task, a syntax which is based on `ed` commands.
This is described below.  </p>

<p>
This is how you <strong>reorder tasks</strong>:
</p>


<pre>
$ t 3m0
0a1
> @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks
3d3
< @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks

$ t
     1	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
     2	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
     3	<span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
</pre>

<p> The <code>3m0</code> is an <strong>ed script</strong>. That's right, todo.rb delegates a
lot of commands to <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29">ed, the venerable Unix
text editor</a>. This gives you a lot of power to edit your todo list from the
command line with very succinct commands, and without disrupting your command
line workflow.  
</p>

<p>So if you wanted to delete the first task, you would use <code>t 1d</code>.
If you wanted to delete a range, you could use something like <code>t 1,3d</code>. 
</p>

<p>
If you want to insert text via an ed
command sequence, put a space after the ed motion
command, followed by the text to insert.  Put quotes around the text if it
contains any characters you don't want interpreted by the shell.
</p>


<p>So for example, this would append a new task after line 3:</p>

<pre>
$ t 3a 'buy some fresh basil @traderjoes'
</pre>

<p> Remember, you do <strong>not</strong> have to use ed commands all the time.
You can always open the todo.txt file and edit it directly in a more conventional
text editor like Vim, Emacs, or TextEdit. You can also use Unix commands like
<code>cat &gt;&gt; todo.txt</code> or <code>echo 'buy arugla @wholefoods' >> todo.txt</code> to add
tasks.  You have many options, and the data format of the todo.txt file is so
simple that there is almost no way you can accidentally corrupt it. But
it's possible to overwrite or delete the file accidentally, so please keep it
backed up or under version control.</p>

<p>
The "do" command marks tasks as done. 
</p>

<pre>
$ t do 2
2d1
< @harvardsq buy some assam from tealuxe

$ t do /moleskine/
1d0
< @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

<p>
You'll notice that in the second instance, we used a <strong>regular expression</strong> 
instead of a line number. This is possible because we are farming out work to `ed`.
Tasks can be identified with ed-style <strong>addressing</strong>.
So in the earlier example, instead of using <code>t 3m0</code>, we could have moved the task 
with <code>t /notebook/m0</code>.
</p>

<p>
What's the difference between <code>t 2d</code> and <code>t do 2</code>? The first command simply deletes a task.
The second command moves it to the done.txt file and timestamps it with the date of
completion. You can display done tasks with the "done" command.
</p>

<pre>
$ t done
     1	2012-01-29 <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
     2	2012-01-29 <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

<p>
To undo a task, use "undo" along with the line number of the done item.
</p>

<pre>
$ t undo 2
1a2
> @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks

$ t
     1	<span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
     2  buy fresh basil <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@traderjoes</span>
     3	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

<p>
You can <strong>filter</strong> tasks by tag like this:
</p>

<pre>
$ t @harvardsq
     3  <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

<p>
You can also <strong>abbreviate tags</strong>. todo.rb will expand the
abbreviated tag to the first tag it finds that matches the abbreviation.
<p>

<pre>
$ t @h
     3  <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks
</pre>

You can list both incomplete and done tasks with the "all" command. You can
pass a context or project tag to "all" to filter the list by that tag.
Again, you can use abbrevation.
</p>

<pre>
$ t all @h
todo
     3	<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy more moleskine notebooks

done
     1	2012-01-29 <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span> buy some assam from tealuxe
</pre>


<p>
There is one more way to highlight and filter items, and that is by flagging
tasks as  <strong>high priority</strong>. A task is deemed to be high
priority if it contains an <strong>exclamation mark</strong>.
You can prioritize an action with the "pri" command and deprioritize it with the "depri" command.
The "pri" command adds an exclamation mark to the end of the task and moves it to the 
top of the list.
</p>

<pre>
$ t pri /notebook/
0a1
> @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks!
3d3
< @harvardsq buy more moleskine notebooks

$ t
<span style='color:#FFFF00'>     1  </span><span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span><span style='color:#FFFF00'> buy more moleskine notebooks!</span>
     2  <span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
     3  buy fresh basil <span style='color:#00FFFF'>@traderjoes</span>
</pre>

<p>If a task contains !!!, the item will actually flash. I'll spare you that
demonstration. </p>


<p>To filter the list to show just priority items, use 
t ! or t ! followed by a tag or tag abbreviation:</p>

<pre>
$ t ! @h
<span style='color:#FFFF00'>     1  </span><span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span><span style='color:#FFFF00'> buy more moleskine notebooks!</span>
</pre>

<p>To see a simple report of your tasks:</p>

<pre>
$ t report
tag            priority     todo     done
-------------- -------- -------- --------
<span style='color:#DC143C'>+opensource</span>           0        1        0
<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@harvardsq</span>            1        1        1
<span style='color:#00FFFF'>@traderjoes</span>           0        1        0
</pre>


<h2>Extras</h2>

<p>If you want to undo a destructive action, you can use the "revert" command:</p>

<pre>t revert</pre>

<p>
Before changing todo.txt, todo.rb backs up todo.txt as .todo.txt.bkp. The
revert command just swaps the two files. If you're versioning your todo.txt and done.txt files
with Git, you can also use "git revert", "git stash" and similar commands 
to achieve the same effect.
</p>

<p>If you don't want colored output, use the -C flag after t.</p>

<p>
todo.rb also lets you <strong>customize colors</strong>.  It will look for a colors.yml
file in the current directory or in ~/.todo.rb/. The colors.yml file can specify 
the color for high priority items, default colors for context and project tags,
as well as special colors for particular tags.
</p>

<p>For example, this colors.yml</p>

<pre>
priority: fuchsia
context: FF69B4
project: FFEBCD
@harvardsq: DDAA00
</pre>


<p>
would color the output like this:
</p>

<pre>
     1  <span style='color:#FFEBCD'>+opensource</span> release todo.rb
     2  buy fresh basil <span style='color:#FF0000'>@traderjoes</span>
<span style='color:#FF00FF'>     3  </span><span style='color:#DDAA00'>@harvardsq</span><span style='color:#FF00FF'> buy more moleskine notebooks!</span>
</pre>


<h2>Tips</h2>

<p> 
I keep a global todo list in ~/todo/todo.txt and per-project todo.txt
files in project folders.  I use t as an alias for todo.rb to manage project todo.txt files.
For managing the global todo.txt, I added this bash function to ~/.bash_profile to let
me use `tt` to edit the global todo list from any directory: 
</p>

<pre>
function tt()  {
  pushd ~/todo && t $@
  popd
}
</pre>

<p>You can use this same technique to wrap todo.rb in a bash function that does
pre- and post-processing, such as pulling changes from an upstream git repository,
committing new changes to git, and pushing those changes upstream.</p>

<pre>
function ttgit()  {
  git pull
  pushd ~/todo && t $@
  git commit -a -m "edit"  2> /dev/null
  git push
  popd
}
</pre>

<p>I synchronize the folder containing my todo.txt, done.txt, and colors.yml
across my computers using a private upstream GitHub repository.  You can also use Dropbox.</p>

<p>You can easily pipe todo.rb output into other Unix tools like
<strong>head</strong>, <strong>grep</strong>, <strong>lpr</strong>, or
<strong>mail</strong>.</p>

<p>
For example, if you have a long list of tasks and you want to stay focused on the top items, you
can do this:
</p>

<pre>
t | head -5
</pre>

<p>
Because todo.rb is a standard, non-interactive Unix command-line program and
todo.txt is a regular text file, you can go wild automating your information flows with Unix scripts.
</p>

<p>
All of the following scripts would be simple to write:
</p>

<p>
You can write crontasks to scan your todo.txt for items with dates and times in
them and send you email reminders when things are due.
</p>

<p> 
You can write a program to poll your Gmail inbox for emails
matching certain rules and create tasks from the subject lines of those emails.
</p>

<p>
You can write a script to publish your todo list to a webserver and to 
automatically update it when the todo list changes. This lets you access your todo lists
from any computer or mobile device, as well as share them with others. 
</p>
