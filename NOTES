Allow configuring git hook before and after any command, so that todo is synced with a repo somewhere.

Priorities: mark with number of !
Tags: mark with .tag (think css classes)

Use a css like stylesheet in config to choose colors

No difference between context and project

To edit a task, use ed. I don't want the screen context to be replaced with a full screen editor.
